Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit, e.g., a class in Java. This concept is also often used to hide the internal representation, or state, of an object from the outside.


Encapsulation is achived by declaring fields private and all methods public within same same class so that variables are not accessed directly from outside class and all methods(logics are hide from outside class.
